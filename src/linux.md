# Linux Distros

Having experimented with various Linux distros I have enjoyed both Arch and Fedora based distros, enjoying Fedora for stability and 1st party support from many manufacturers, and Arch for ease of staying up to date on development tools (I love AUR).

> Debian based distros like Ubuntu are very behind on versions of dev tools needed day to day for bleeding edge development and require you to build newer versions from source etc. and struggle with possible kernel/driver incompatibilites and hence I do not recommend them.

## Base vs derived distros

In the discussion of Fedora vs Nobara and Arch vs CachyOS I would use this rule of thumb:

>If you have an NVidia GPU I recommend distros that make it easy to install drivers for it.

I have previously had kernels destroyed by doing a small wrong move or wrongthink during nvidia driver installation and hence if I want good GPU support I will trust the gaming optimised distro developers to have done it right for me. The guides will still explain how to install the drivers on base distros of course.
